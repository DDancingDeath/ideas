## Supported Printers

### Tested
- Generic 80mm ESC/POS thermal printers
- Most Android-compatible Bluetooth thermal printers

### Compatible Brands (Likely to work)
- Epson TM series (with Devanagari support for Hindi)
- Star Micronics
- Zebra mobile printers
- GOOJPRT portable printers
- Xprinter XP-P300
- Any ESC/POS compatible 80mm printer with Bluetooth

**For Hindi Support**: Look for printers with:
- Devanagari font support
- Multi-language capability
- Indian market models (often support regional languages)

### Requirements
- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) support
- ESC/POS command set
- 80mm paper width (48 characters per line)
- Android 5.0+ device

## Troubleshooting

### Printer Not Found During Scan
1. Ensure printer is powered on
2. Put printer in pairing mode (check printer manual)
3. Check if printer is already connected to another device
4. Try restarting the printer

### Connection Fails
1. Ensure location permission is granted (required for Bluetooth)
2. Check if printer is within range (typically 10 meters)
3. Restart printer and try again
4. Check printer battery if portable

### Prints Garbled Text
1. Verify printer supports ESC/POS commands
2. Check paper width settings (should be 80mm)
3. Try test print to verify formatting
4. Some printers may need specific initialization

### Nothing Prints
1. Check printer has paper loaded
2. Verify printer is not in error state (out of paper, cover open, etc.)
3. Use test print to verify connection
4. Check printer Bluetooth LED is active

### Hindi Characters Show as Boxes/Garbled
- Most ESC/POS thermal printers don't support Devanagari (Hindi) Unicode characters
- The printer firmware only supports ASCII and limited extended character sets
- Hindi text will appear as boxes (□) or question marks (?)
- **Solution**: Use a thermal printer that explicitly supports Hindi/Devanagari fonts
- **Alternative**: Use English item names for Bluetooth receipts
- Web print (browser print dialog) fully supports Hindi on any printer

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Additions
1. **QR Code Support** - Add QR codes to receipts for bill lookup
2. **Logo Printing** - Add business logo at top of receipt
3. **Custom Paper Width** - Support for 58mm printers
4. **Print Templates** - Multiple receipt formats
5. **Auto-reconnect** - Reconnect to last used printer on app start
6. **Multiple Printers** - Support switching between multiple printers
7. **Print Preview** - Show receipt preview before printing

### Configuration Options
- Receipt footer customization
- Business name/address on receipt
- Receipt language selection
- Font size adjustment
- Print density control

## Web Print vs Bluetooth Print

| Feature | Web Print | Bluetooth Print |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| Platform | All (web + mobile) | Mobile app only |
| Printer Type | Any USB/Network | Bluetooth thermal |
| Hindi Support | ✓ Full | Limited |
| Speed | Slower (dialog) | Fast (direct) |
| Paper Size | A4/Letter | 80mm thermal |
| Auto-cut | No | Yes |
| Setup | None | One-time pairing |
| Cost | Any printer | Thermal printer (~₹5000-15000) |

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Setup Phase**
   - Connect Bluetooth printer once
   - Test print to verify
   - Keep web print as backup

2. **Daily Operations**
   - All prints automatically use Bluetooth
   - Fast, silent printing
   - Auto paper cut
   - No printer dialogs

3. **Backup Option**
   - If Bluetooth fails, use web print
   - Regular printer for reports/backup
   - A4 print for detailed records

## Notes

- Bluetooth printing requires Android device with BLE support
- Web browser version always uses web print dialog
- Printer connection persists across app restarts
- Battery-powered printers need charging regularly
- Thermal paper fades over time (store important receipts digitally)
