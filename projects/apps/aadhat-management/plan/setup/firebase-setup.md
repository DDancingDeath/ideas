## 🚀 How to Use

### First Time Setup

1. **Open the Application**
   - Go to: http://127.0.0.1:8080 (or your deployed URL)
   - You'll see the login/register screen

2. **Create First Account**
   - Click "Register" tab
   - Enter:
     - Name: Your name
     - Email: your@email.com
     - Password: (minimum 6 characters)
     - Confirm password
   - Click "Register"
   - **First registered user automatically becomes OWNER** 🎉

3. **Start Using the App**
   - After registration, you'll be logged in automatically
   - All your data will be saved to Firebase
   - Add items, create bills, record sales!

### Adding More Users

Currently, to add more users:
1. Share the app URL with them
2. They create their own account (will have 'owner' role by default)
3. You can manually change their role in Firebase Console

**Future Enhancement:** User management UI coming soon!

---

## 🔥 Firebase Console Access

You can view and manage your data in Firebase Console:

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select project: **Aadhat Management**
3. Navigate to:
   - **Authentication** → See all users
   - **Firestore Database** → View all data
   - **Rules** → Set security rules (see below)

---

## 🔒 Important: Security Rules

⚠️ **CRITICAL STEP** - Set up security rules in Firebase Console:

1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules
2. Replace the default rules with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // User must be authenticated
    function isSignedIn() {
      return request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // User role from users collection
    function getUserRole() {
      return get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role;
    }
    
    // Check if user is owner
    function isOwner() {
      return isSignedIn() && getUserRole() == 'owner';
    }
    
    // Check if user is manager or owner
    function isManagerOrOwner() {
      return isSignedIn() && getUserRole() in ['owner', 'manager'];
    }
    
    // Users collection
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if isSignedIn();
      allow write: if isSignedIn() && (request.auth.uid == userId || isOwner());
    }
    
    // Items collection
    match /items/{itemId} {
      allow read: if isSignedIn();
      allow create, update: if isSignedIn();
      allow delete: if isOwner();
    }
    
    // Bills collection
    match /bills/{billId} {
      allow read: if isSignedIn();
      allow create: if isSignedIn();
      allow update: if isSignedIn() && (resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid || isOwner());
      allow delete: if isOwner();
    }
    
    // Sales collection
    match /sales/{saleId} {
      allow read: if isSignedIn();
      allow create: if isSignedIn();
      allow update: if isSignedIn() && (resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid || isOwner());
      allow delete: if isOwner();
    }
    
    // Payments collection
    match /payments/{paymentId} {
      allow read: if isSignedIn();
      allow create: if isSignedIn();
      allow update: if isSignedIn() && (resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid || isManagerOrOwner());
      allow delete: if isOwner();
    }
    
    // Stock Adjustments collection
    match /stockAdjustments/{adjustmentId} {
      allow read: if isSignedIn();
      allow create: if isManagerOrOwner();
      allow update: if isOwner();
      allow delete: if isOwner();
    }
  }
}
```

3. Click "Publish"

These rules ensure:
- Only authenticated users can access data
- Users can only modify their own data (except owners)
- Owners have full access
- Managers can manage stock and expenses
- Staff can only create bills and sales

## 📱 Multi-Device Usage

### How It Works
1. **Login on Device 1**: Create a bill on your computer
2. **Login on Device 2**: Open the app on your phone
3. **See Live Updates**: The bill appears automatically!
4. **Offline Support**: No internet? No problem! Changes sync when back online.

### Testing Real-Time Sync
1. Open app in TWO browser windows
2. Login with SAME account in both
3. Add an item in window 1
4. Watch it appear in window 2 instantly! ✨
